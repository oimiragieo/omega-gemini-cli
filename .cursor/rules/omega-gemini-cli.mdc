# Omega Gemini CLI (headless)

When the user wants to **use Gemini** for analysis, large files, sandbox execution, or brainstorming, use the **omega-gemini-cli** skill and run the **headless script** (no MCP).

## When to use

- User says "use Gemini", "ask Gemini", "analyze with Gemini", "run in Gemini sandbox", "brainstorm with Gemini", or similar.
- Task benefits from Gemini's large context or a second model's perspective.

## How to run Gemini

From the project root (where `.claude` lives), run:

```bash
node .claude/skills/omega-gemini-cli/scripts/ask-gemini.mjs "PROMPT"
```

Optional: add `--model gemini-2.5-flash`, `--sandbox`, or `--json`. Build the prompt from the user's request and any @ file refs. Return the script's stdout as Gemini's response.

## If Gemini CLI is not set up

If the script fails (e.g. "gemini not found"), suggest the user run **/omega-gemini-setup** and complete Node + Gemini CLI install and one-time auth. See .claude/skills/omega-gemini-cli/references/installation.md and references/auth.md.
